# TOSCA Community Contributions

This GitHub public repository ( <b><a
href="https://github.com/oasis-open/tosca-community-contributions">https://github.com/oasis-open/tosca-community-contributions</a></b>
) was created at the <a
href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-2420"> request</a>
of the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tosca/">OASIS
Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications
(TOSCA) TC</a> as an <a
href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/">OASIS
TC Open Repository</a> to support development of open source resources
related to Technical Committee work.

While this TC Open Repository remains associated with the sponsor TC,
its development priorities, leadership, intellectual property terms,
participation rules, and other matters of governance are <a

and distinct</a> from the OASIS TC Process and related policies.

## Statement of Purpose

This repository manages TOSCA service templates and definitions that
are contributed by the TOSCA community and that can serve as a
starting point to help community members with their TOSCA
projects. Contributions may include (but are not limited to) the
following:

- *Profiles*: collections of TOSCA type definitions for specific
   application domains.
- *Examples*: example service templates (and associated artifacts)
   that can be used to deploy simple services.
- *[Tests](https://github.com/oasis-open/tosca-community-contributions/tests/README.md)*: service templates that can be used by parser designers or
   orchestrator designers to check compliance with the TOSCA
   specification.
- *Tools*: parsers, validators, translators, orchestrators, or other
   tools contributed by the TOSCA community.
- *Best practices*: design patterns and development methodologies that
   are intended to optimize the quality of TOSCA profiles and service
   templates.

Note that this repository is not intended to track all implementations
of the TOSCA language. For a list of such implementations, please
refer to the [Known TOSCA
Implementations](https://github.com/oasis-open/tosca-community-contributions/wiki/Known-TOSCA-Implementations)
wiki page.
