# Overview

TOSCA v2.0 marks a significant evolution of the TOSCA standard,
expanding beyond its computing-centric roots to become a *universal
orchestration language* applicable across virtually any domain, from
traditional IT infrastructure to IoT deployments, edge computing, and
industry-specific automation requirements. TOSCA V2.0 greatly increases
the fields of applicability of the standard and marks a fundamental
shift in cloud orchestration accessibility. By eliminating the
restrictive "Simple Profile" terminology that previously limited the
standard to computing environments, TOSCA V2.0 empowers organizations
across industries to create and contribute user-defined profiles using
terminology specific to their domain and use cases.

This document highlights the major advances introduced in the TOSCA v2.0
standard.

# Remove Simple Profile Types

TOSCA v2.0 removes the Simple Profile type definitions that were part of
TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML v1.3. These type definitions are now
managed as an open-source project in the tosca-community-contributions
GitHub repository. This change decouples TOSCA from its ties to *legacy*
IaaS clouds and instead evolves TOSCA v2.0 into a pure language
specification that can be used across a wide variety of application
domains. Specifically, TOSCA is now seeing adoption in the following
domains:

- Cloud-native software deployments

- Telecommunications

- Industrial automation

- IoT

- Functions-as-a-Service

As a side effect of the removal of type definitions from the standard,
TOSCA v2.0 also removes all language dependencies on these Simple
Profile types. For example, TOSCA v2.0 removes the HOST keyword that
assumes the presence of the tosca.relationships.HostedOn relationship
type.

# Support for Community-Defined Profiles

Instead of defining standard types as part of TOSCA, TOSCA v2.0 provides
support for domain-specific profiles that can be defined by TOSCA users.
TOSCA profiles are libraries of type definitions, service templates, and
artifacts that can be accessed by or onboarded into an Orchestrator and
imported by other service templates using their well-known profile name.
This approach eliminates the need for service designers to package such
libraries with every service template that uses them.

Examples of community-defined TOSCA profiles are the ETSI NFV profile or
a community-defined Kubernetes profile.

To support named profiles, TOSCA v2.0 includes the following additional
improvements:

- It removes automatic import of Simple Profile

- It clarifies and enhances syntax for import statements

- It formalizes support for namespaces in TOSCA

# Support for In-Life Operation of Running Services

Whereas TOSCA v1.3 is exclusively an Orchestration standard, TOSCA v2.0
is designed to handle all phases of a service lifecycle. This includes
service design, service deployment, ongoing service management, and
service decommissioning. Support for end-to-end service lifecycle
management is provided by the following enhancements introduced in the
TOSCA v2.0 specification:

## Functional Architecture

TOSCA v2.0 introduces a functional architecture that formalizes the role
of *Service Representations* (renamed from Instance Models) in the
Service Lifecycle. This architecture defines the following concepts and
the lifecycle phase in which they are used:

- *Node Types* define reusable components (Design Time)

- *Node Templates* are created based on Node Types (Design Time)

- *Node Representations* are created from Node Templates (Deployment
  Time)

- *Node Implementations* (in the external world) are created from Node
  Representations (Deployment Time)

- *Node Representations and Node Implementations* are kept in sync by
  the Orchestrator (Runtime)

<!-- -->

- In response to changes in the (external) Node Instance state

- In response to user actions

## TOSCA Operational Model

The TOSCA functional architecture is accompanied by an Operational Model
that defines how service designers can expect TOSCA Orchestrators to
process their Service Templates. This operational model is intended to
address:

- How are service representations created from service templates?

- How and when are property and attribute values assigned?

- How and when are requirements fulfilled?

- How and when is substitution done?

- How and when are workflows run and interface operations called?

- How are operation outputs reflected into the service representation?

- How are artifacts processed?

## Modifying Running Services

Using TOSCA v2.0, operators can update or modify running services by
providing updated values for the inputs defined in the service template
from which the service was created. These updated values are propagated
to properties and attributes of nodes and relationships in the service
representation using \$get_input functions defined in the template.

TOSCA v2.0 defines the associated *modify* semantics that need to be
implemented by the Orchestrator in response to the resulting changes in
property or attribute values, specifically:

- Which property value changes require deletion and recreation of nodes
  and relationships?

- Which property value changes allow for simple modify operations?

- Which relationships persist after changes to nodes, and which
  relationships need to be reestablished after modification?

- When do source nodes of relationships need to be recreated after the
  target node is modified.

- When do substituted nodes require a different substituting service?

# Formalized Expression Syntax

TOSCA v2.0 significantly enhances the expressiveness of the TOSCA
language through the following features:

## TOSCA Functions

TOSCA v2.0 improves support for functions as follows:

1.  TOSCA v2.0 formalizes function syntax to clearly distinguish
    function expressions from other named entities in the language.

2.  TOSCA v2.0 introduces function definition grammar that defines
    function signatures and typed return values. This allows for
    design-time validation of function expressions.

3.  TOSCA v2.0 extends the set of built-in functions that must be
    supported by the Orchestrator

4.  TOSCA v2.0 introduces support for user-defined custom functions that
    can be bundled with profiles or defined in TOSCA files.

## TOSCA Path

TOSCA v2.0 introduces a new TOSCA Path syntax that allows a defined
traversal of an arbitrary graph of nodes and relationships to an
attribute or property. This grammar is modeled after Xpath and JSONPath
and extends grammar used in the get_property and get_attribute functions
in the TOSCA v1.3 standard.

# Various Grammar Improvements

In addition to major feature enhancements, TOSCA v2.0 also includes
various improvements to the TOSCA grammar as compared to TOSCA v1.3.
These improvements are intended to simplify use of the language, clarify
functionality and resolve ambiguities. They include the following:

## Built-In Data Type Definitions

- TOSCA v2.0 removes all dependencies on YAML type definitions. Instead,
  TOSCA data types are defined independently of types defined in YAML or
  in the programming language used by the Orchestrator.

- TOSCA v2.0 Introduce a bytes type for binary data

## Harmonized Syntax for Constraints, Conditions, and Filters

TOSCA v2.0 harmonizes constraint syntax, filter syntax, and condition
syntax by using Boolean functions throughout.

## Syntax for Entity Refinements

- TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML v1.3 includes examples of *Entity
  Refinement* where derived types can refine and augment entities
  defined in their base types

- TOSCA v2.0 formally defines entity refinement syntax to remove any
  ambiguity related to this functionality.

## Multiplicity

- TOSCA v2.0 documents how to create multiple node representations from
  the same node template and multiple relationships from the same
  requirement assignment.

- It formalizes the impact of node multiplicity on cardinality of
  relationships.

## Extended Substitution Mapping Grammar

TOSCA v2.0 addresses shortcomings of the v1.3 substitution mapping
grammar. It formalizes how to map multiple requirements of the
substituted node to requirements of nodes in the substituting service.

## Complete (and simplified) CSAR specification

- The TOSCA v2.0 specification includes a definition of the CSAR file
  format. It also simplifies and extends the CSAR file format.

- This removes the need to reference the TOSCA v1.0 in XML
  specification.
