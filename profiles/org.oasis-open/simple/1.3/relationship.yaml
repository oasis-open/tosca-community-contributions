          A unique identifier of the realized instance of a

          This attribute reflects the name of the Relationship
          Template as defined in the TOSCA service template.  This
          name is not unique to the realized instance model of
          corresponding deployed application as each template in the
          model can result in one or more instances (e.g., scaled)
          when orchestrated to a provider environment.
