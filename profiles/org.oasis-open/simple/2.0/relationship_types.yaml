  Root:
    description: >
      The TOSCA base relationship type from which all other normative
      TOSCA relationship types derive.
    interfaces:
      Configure:
        type: Relationship.Configure

  DependsOn:
    description: >-
      The DependsOn type represents a general dependency relationship
      between two nodes.
    derived_from: Root
    valid_target_types: [ Node ]

  HostedOn:
    description: >-
      The HostedOn type represents a hosting relationship between two
      nodes.
    derived_from: Root
    valid_target_types: [ Container ]

  ConnectsTo:
    description: >-
      The ConnectsTo type represents a network connection relationship
      between two nodes.
    derived_from: Root
    valid_target_types: [ Endpoint ]
    properties:
      credential:
        description: >-
          The security credential to present to the target endpoint
          for either authentication or authorization purposes.
        type: Credential
        required: false

  AttachesTo:
    description: >-
      The AttachesTo type represents an attachment relationship
      between two nodes (e.g. for attaching a storage node to a
      Compute node).
    derived_from: Root
    valid_target_types: [ Attachment ]
    properties:
      location:
        description: >-
          The relative location (e.g., mount point on the file system)
          that provides the root location to address the attached node.
        type: string
        constraints:
          - min_length: 1
      device:
        description: >-

        type: string
        required: false

  LinksTo:
    description: >-
      The LinksTo type represents an association relationship between
      Port and Network node types.
    derived_from: DependsOn
    valid_target_types: [ Linkable ]

  BindsTo:
    description: >-
      The BindsTo type represents an association relationship between
      Port and Compute node types.
    derived_from: DependsOn
    valid_target_types: [ Bindable ]

  RoutesTo:
    description: >-
      The RoutesTo type represents an intentional network routing
      between two Endpoints in different networks.
    derived_from: ConnectsTo
    valid_target_types: [ Endpoint ]
