# XLAB Steampunk Amazon Profile

The profile in this directory defines TOSCA types for interfacing to
Amazon Web Services EC2. It was contributed and created by [Matej
Artaƒç](matej.artac@xlab.si) under the auspices of [XLAB
Steampunk](https://steampunk.si/). Matej authored the profile in June
2020, and it was demonstrated to run in the [XLAB xOpera TOSCA
orchestrator](https://github.com/xlab-si/xopera-opera).

This profile is the result of a project aimed at building a fully
working library for EC2. It was started at a time when XLAB had an
effort to create a good alternative to the AWS Ansible collection, but
which wasn't fully featured yet. The type definitions in this profile
are intended to be independent of specific deployment technologies,
but all implementation artifacts are provided as Ansible playbooks.
