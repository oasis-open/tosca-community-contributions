# Implementation Details

- Tal suggested creating a special TOSCA interface called
  "Configuration" that could generate environment variables during
  initialization, allowing software to be configured based on the
  topology. This approach would enable the creation of custom scripts
  that understand specific software needs, similar to Nephio's
  configuration process.

- Tal suggested that this may involve the creation of profiles that
  define data types and potentially require custom functions or
  artifacts.

- While the current TOSCA functions might not be sufficient for
  generating environment variables, a custom function could be
  developed to simplify the process.

- Marcel raised a question about how the software would understand
  environment variable names, to which Tal responded that this would
  be part of the onboarding process.

- A list of relationships between services is necessary for interface
  definitions, though the specific method of generating this list is
  less important.
