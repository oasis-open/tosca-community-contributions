description: >-
  TOSCA Data Profile type definitions. This files contains
  definitions that provide more concrete types derived from
  Data abstract node type. All node types defined hereafter
  are derived from abstract Data node type defined in the
  base profile.

node_types:
  AtRestData:
    description: >-
      This node type represents a set of authoritative,
      persistent data stored within the system’s trust
      boundary. It is durably persisted, accessible on
      demand with predictable latency, and independent
      of streaming or event-driven mechanisms (e.g. DB,
      local/network filesystem, object storage, etc.)
    derived_from: Data
  BatchData:
    description: >-
      This node type represents data produced, delivered
      or ingested at scheduled intervals rather than
      continuously or on demand. It is not event-driven
      and is typically generated via periodic processes
      (e.g., ETL pipelines, daily exports)
    derived_from: Data
  StreamingData:
    description: >-
      This node type represents produced and transmitted
      as an ongoing, unbounded flow. Consumers process
      data in real time or near real time as it arrives
      (e.g. Kafka topics etc.)
    derived_from: Data
  EventData:
    description: >-
      This node type represents data generated or delivered
      as discrete, individual events, not as a continuous
      stream. Each event is meaningful on its own and
      typically represents a state change or notification
      (e.g. notifications, message queues, SQS, etc.)
    derived_from: Data
  ApiData:
    description: >-
      This node type represents data obtained by invoking
      a remote service via synchronous request/response
      interactions (e.g. REST, gRPC, GraphQL)
    derived_from: Data
  CachedData:
    description: >-
      This node type represents ephemeral, non-authoritative
      data retrieved from a cache layer, either local or
      distributed, that stores values temporarily to improve
      performance or reduce load on authoritative sources
      (e.g. Redis, Memcached, etc.)
