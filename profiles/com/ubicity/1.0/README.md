# TOSCA Profile Design Patterns

Ubicity uses a number of design patterns to aid the development of
TOSCA profiles. These patterns are described in this section.

## Component/Port Pattern

TOSCA uses a **Component/Port** pattern where a component’s touch
points for interacting with other components are modeled separately
from that component using *port* abstractions. Using TOSCA, components
are modeled using *Node Types* and the ports of those components are
modeled using the following two different abstractions associated with
node types:
- Capabilities: for functionality exposed by a component and usable by
  other components.
- Requirements: for dependencies of one component on functionality
  exposed by other components.

The Ubicity Component/Port pattern defines *common* categories of
functionality that are typically exposed by all components. It then
attempts to define *common* capability types and *common* relationship
types to represent each of these categories of functionality. Note
that this pattern is inspired by the [ONF Core Information
Model](https://opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/models-apis/),
the [TMF Open Digital Architecture](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/), and
other modeling efforts that use a similar approach. These standard
categories of functionality are shown in the following picture:

- **Runtime environment**: most if not all TOSCA nodes are contained
  by (*hosted on*) another node and their lifecycle is determined by
  the lifecycle of the containing node. This containment dependency is
  expressed using an *execution environment requirement* that must be
  fulfilled by a corresponding *execution environment capability* of
  the containing node. Nodes that can *host* other nodes typically
  have their own *runtime environment requirement*.
- **Core functionality**: the main function of a TOSCA node is to
  provide a specific set of features or functionality to other
  nodes. This is expressed using a *core functionality
  capability**. Other nodes will define requirements for this
  functionality.
- **Management**: many TOSCA nodes are matched with a corresponding
  management tool. This relationship is expressed as a *management
  requirement* of the managed TOSCA node rather than as a *management
  capability* to express potential deployment dependencies: if the
  management tool is used to configure the TOSCA node, the management
  tool must be deployed before the managed node can be fully deployed.
  Note that for management tools, the management functions are exposed
  as their *core functionality capability*.
- **Monitoring**: many TOSCA nodes are matched with a corresponding
  monitoring tool. This relationship is expressed as a *monitoring*
  capability of the monitored node.

  > This pattern was discussed in the TOSCA TC but never formalized.

- **Security**: access to TOSCA nodes may need to be secured.

  > This pattern needs further work

As stated earlier, Ubicity uses this pattern to define common
capability types and common relationship types for these various
categories of functionality.
