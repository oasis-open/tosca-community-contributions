# TOSCA Profile Design Patterns

Ubicity uses a several design patterns to help guide the development
of TOSCA profiles. These patterns are described in this document.

## Abstraction
To manage the complexities associated with large scale systems and
services, the Ubicity modeling approach relies heavily on the use of
*abstraction*. Abstraction allows for the creation of models that
ignore implementation-specific details.

### The Policy Continuum
To help guide the use of abstraction in service modeling, Ubicity
leverages the [*policy
continuum*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140366408002302)
introduced by [John
Strassner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-strassner-41ba98a). While
the policy continuum was originally introduced to assist with the
definition of *policies* at various levels of abstraction, Ubicity
also uses it to assist with the creation of *models* to which these
policies can be applied.

The policy continuum recommends five different levels of abstraction
as shown in the following picture:

![Policy Continuum](images/abstraction.png?raw=true)

**Business View**: describes services in terms of business goals. It
models services as products that are available to customers.

**System View**: describes the architectural components of the service
in a technology-agnostic fashion. It the system architecture used to
meet the business objectives specified in the business view.

**Administrator View**: specifies technologies used for each of the
architectural components in the system. It introduces
technology-specific implementations for the architecture specified in
the system view.

**Device View**: lists specific devices or software components-as well
as their associated configurations-for all of the components of the
service. It introduces vendor-specific equipment for the technologies
used in the administrator view.

**Instance View**: captures the state of each instance.

### The Model Continuum
For the purpose of creating service models that drive *TOSCA
orchestration*, only system view, administrator view, and device view
levels are important as shown in the following figure:

![TOSCA Levels of Abstraction](images/tosca_abstraction.png?raw=true)

Using a **top-down** modeling approach, system designers create
abstract system view models to define the architecture of their
systems. These models are then extended using administrator view
models that introduce the technologies chosen to implement the system
architecture. Finally, device view models specify specific vendor
implementations for the chosed technologies.

### Translating Between Levels of Abstraction
During the orchestration process, models at a higher level of
abstraction must be extended with information at the next lower level
of abstraction. TOSCA provides two mechanisms to accomplish this:

#### Derivation

Using the derivation approach, base node types define abstract
definitions. Derived types provide concrete implementations for those
abstract definitions. This approach is shown in the following figure:

![Derivation](images/derivation.png?raw=true)

#### Substitution

Using the substitution approach, base node types define an abstract
interface, a *facade* if you will. Substituting templates provide
concrete implementations for the abstract facade. This approach is
shown in the following figure:

![Substitution](images/substitution.png?raw=true)

### Abstraction Best Practices

Ubicity recommends the following best practices for creating abstract
models:

> Note that these recommendations are still in flux. They may change
> based on additional experience. In addition, the profiles defined in
> this repository do not yet fully comply with these guidelines.

- Avoid mixing and matching types defined at different levels of
  abstraction within the same profile. Instead, define separate TOSCA
  profiles for level of abstractions. Specifically, define a profile
  for system view models, a profile for administrator view models, and
  a profile for device view models.
- Avoid mixing and matching types defined at different levels of
  abstraction within the same TOSCA service template.
- Use *substitution* to map from the system view level of abstraction
  to the administrator view level of abstraction, as shown in the
  following figure:


- Use *derivation* to map from the administrator view level of
  abstraction to the device view level of abstraction, as shown in the
  following figure:

  ![Translate administrator view to device view](images/administrator_to_device.png?raw=true)
- Since substitution mapping may require sharing of capability types
  and relationship types between different profiles, introduce a
  *common* profile that defines these relationship types and
  capability types. Only this common profile should define top-level
  relationship types or capability types. Profile-specific types
  should derive from one of the base types defined in the common
  profile.
- Maintain a shallow capability type hierarchy. Specifically, avoid
  creating subtypes to constrain which source nodes can use a certain
  capability. Instead, constrain the *generic* capability type with
  `valid_source_node_type` statements.

Note that these guidelines do not prohibit the use of *inheritance*
for types defined in *system view* profiles. In fact, inheritance
could be useful to define base node types that define common
functionality (e.g. interfaces) that is shared by all node types
derived from that common base type. However, inheritancy should not be
used to add technology-specific or vendor-specific implementations to
abstract node types.

### Organizing Ubicity TOSCA Profiles

The Ubicity TOSCA Profiles have been designed with these recommended
best practices in mind. Their organization is shown in the following
figure:

![Ubicity profile organization](images/ubicity-profiles.png?raw=true)

- The Ubicity Cloud Profile (*to be provided*) defines abstract node
  types that are used to define system architectures. These types are
  technology and vendor-independent and are intended to be substituted
  by templates that use types defined in the vendor-specific profiles.
- The main [Ubicity Profile](1.0/) defines technology-specific node
  types. Many of these types are intended to be used as base types for
  the types defined in the vendor-specific profiles.
- The AWS, Openstack, and Proxmox profiles (*to be provided*) define
  vendor-specific node types. Where possible, these types derive from
  the vendor-independent types defined in the Ubicity Profile.
- The [Ubicity Core Profile](core/1.0/) defines types that are shared
  between profiles at different levels of abstraction. It primarily
  defines base capability types, base relationship types, common data
  types, and common artifact types.

### Mapping Relationship Types

> It is likely that the same guidelines about abstraction apply to
  defining relationship types as well. However, the TOSCA spec is
  somewhat vague about whether requirement mappings rules (and
  capability mapping rules for that matter) require that the
  relationships resulting from the mapping have types that are
  compatible with the relationship of the mapped requirement. If that
  is the case, then these relationship types (and capability types)
  must be shared between System View, Administrator View, and Device
  View profiles and may need to be organized in a *common* profile.

## Component/Port Pattern

TOSCA uses a **Component/Port** pattern where a componentâ€™s touch
points for interacting with other components are modeled separately
from that component using *port* abstractions. Using TOSCA, components
are modeled using *Node Types* and the ports of those components are
modeled using the following two different abstractions associated with
node types:
- Capabilities: for functionality exposed by a component and usable by
  other components.
- Requirements: for dependencies of one component on functionality
  exposed by other components.

The Ubicity Component/Port pattern defines *common* categories of
functionality that are typically exposed by all components. It then
attempts to define *common* capability types and *common* relationship
types to represent each of these categories of functionality. Note
that this pattern is inspired by the [ONF Core Information
Model](https://opennetworking.org/software-defined-standards/models-apis/),
the [TMF Open Digital Architecture](https://www.tmforum.org/oda/), and
other modeling efforts that use a similar approach. These standard
categories of functionality are shown in the following picture:

![Component/Port Pattern](images/component-port.png?raw=true)

- **Runtime environment**: most if not all TOSCA nodes are contained
  by (*hosted on*) another node and their lifecycle is determined by
  the lifecycle of the containing node. This containment dependency is
  expressed using an *execution environment requirement* that must be
  fulfilled by a corresponding *execution environment capability* of
  the containing node. Nodes that can *host* other nodes typically
  have their own *runtime environment requirement*.
- **Core functionality**: the main function of a TOSCA node is to
  provide a specific set of features or functionality to other
  nodes. This is expressed using a *core functionality
  capability**. Other nodes will define requirements for this
  functionality.
- **Management**: many TOSCA nodes are matched with a corresponding
  management tool. This relationship is expressed as a *management
  requirement* of the managed TOSCA node rather than as a *management
  capability* to express potential deployment dependencies: if the
  management tool is used to configure the TOSCA node, the management
  tool must be deployed before the managed node can be fully deployed.
  Note that for management tools, the management functions are exposed
  as their *core functionality capability*.
- **Monitoring**: many TOSCA nodes are matched with a corresponding
  monitoring tool. This relationship is expressed as a *monitoring*
  capability of the monitored node.

  > This pattern was discussed in the TOSCA TC but never formalized.

- **Security**: access to TOSCA nodes may need to be secured.

  > This pattern needs further work

As stated earlier, Ubicity uses this pattern to define common
capability types and common relationship types for these various
categories of functionality. These types are discussed next.

### Best Practices
Best practices questions:

- Specific relationship types may need to get matched with specific
  capability types. This constraint can be specified:
  - Just in the relationship type using the `valid_capability_types`
    keyword.
  - Just in the capability type using the `valid_relationship_types`
    keyword.
  - In both places.

  Which one is the best way to go?

- How deep do we make the relationship type and capability type
  hierarchies? Or, said a different way, when is it appropriate to
  define new derived relationship and/or capability types? We should
  consider the following scenarios:

   1. Derived type names can more clearly indicate the intended
      function of the relationship or capability and improve
      *readability* of profiles and templates.
   2. Additional properties and/or attributes need to be defined for
      relationships or capabilities.
   3. Additional inputs and/or operation implementations need to be
      defined for relationship interfaces.
   4. Additional interfaces need to be defined on relationships.

- If specific capabilities are needed, and specific relationships to
  those capabilities are needed, there are two ways to define these:

   1. We can create derived capability types and associated
      relationship types and use those types in requirement and
      capability definitions.
   2. We can use the base types as-is, and *specialize* how they can
      be used in capability and requirement definitions using the
      `valid_source_node_types` and `valid_target_node_types`
      keywords.
