          Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not allowed. Fragments
          ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either.

          labelSelectorPath defines the JSON path inside of a custom resource that corresponds to
          Scale `status.selector`. Only JSON paths without the array notation are allowed. Must be
          a JSON Path under `.status` or `.spec`. Must be set to work with HorizontalPodAutoscaler.
          The field pointed by this JSON path must be a string field (not a complex selector struct)
          which contains a serialized label selector in string form. If there is no value under the
          given path in the custom resource, the `status.selector` value in the `/scale`
          subresource will default to the empty string.

      CustomResourceSubresourceStatus defines how to serve the status subresource for
      CustomResources. Status is represented by the `.status` JSON path inside of a CustomResource.
      When set,

      * exposes a /status subresource for the custom resource

      * PUT requests to the /status subresource take a custom resource object, and ignore changes to
      anything except the status stanza

      * PUT/POST/PATCH requests to the custom resource ignore changes to the status stanza.
