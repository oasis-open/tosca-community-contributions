      name:
        description: >-
          Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some
          resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name
          automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
          definition. Cannot be updated.

      generateName:
        description: >-
          GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF
          the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the name returned to the
          client will be different than the name passed. This value will also be combined with a
          unique suffix. The provided value has the same validation rules as the Name field, and may
          be truncated by the length of the suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
          If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT return a 409
          - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason ServerTimeout indicating a
          unique name could not be found in the time allotted, and the client should retry
          (optionally after the time indicated in the Retry-After header). Applied only if Name is

          uninitialized and is hidden (in list/watch and get calls) from clients that haven't

          An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by

          The name of the cluster which the object belongs to. This is used to distinguish resources

      creationTimestamp:
        description: >-
          CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was
          created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate
          operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in
          UTC. Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists.
        type: timestamp
      deletionTimestamp:
        description: >-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This
          field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not
          directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible
          from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the
          finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is
          blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further
          into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this
          time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet
          will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After
          that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the
          container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
          partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or
          automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful
          deletion of the object has not been requested. Populated by the system when a graceful
          deletion is requested. Read-only.
        type: timestamp
      deletionGracePeriodSeconds:
        description: >-
          Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be
          removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be
          shortened. Read-only.

          a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or "beta" and another
          number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a
