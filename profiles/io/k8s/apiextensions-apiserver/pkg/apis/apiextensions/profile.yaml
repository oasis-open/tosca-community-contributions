          The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address.
          
          Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster.
          
          The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

        description: >-
          MessageExpression declares a CEL expression that evaluates to the
          validation failure message that is returned when this rule fails.
          Since messageExpression is used as a failure message, it must evaluate
          to a string. If both message and messageExpression are present on a
          rule, then messageExpression will be used if validation fails. If
          messageExpression results in a runtime error, the runtime error is
          logged, and the validation failure message is produced as if the
          messageExpression field were unset. If messageExpression evaluates to
          an empty string, a string with only spaces, or a string that contains
          line breaks, then the validation failure message will also be produced
          as if the messageExpression field were unset, and the fact that
          messageExpression produced an empty string/string with only
          spaces/string with line breaks will be logged. messageExpression has
          access to all the same variables as the rule; the only difference is

          reason of the first failed validation rule. The currently supported

        required: false
        type: string
      rule:
        description: >-
          Rule represents the expression which will be evaluated by CEL. ref: https://github.com/google/cel-spec The Rule is scoped to the location of the x-kubernetes-validations extension in the schema. The `self` variable in the CEL expression is bound to the scoped value. Example: - Rule scoped to the root of a resource with a status subresource: {"rule": "self.status.actual <= self.spec.maxDesired"}
          
          If the Rule is scoped to an object with properties, the accessible properties of the object are field selectable via `self.field` and field presence can be checked via `has(self.field)`. Null valued fields are treated as absent fields in CEL expressions. If the Rule is scoped to an object with additionalProperties (i.e. a map) the value of the map are accessible via `self[mapKey]`, map containment can be checked via `mapKey in self` and all entries of the map are accessible via CEL macros and functions such as `self.all(...)`. If the Rule is scoped to an array, the elements of the array are accessible via `self[i]` and also by macros and functions. If the Rule is scoped to a scalar, `self` is bound to the scalar value. Examples: - Rule scoped to a map of objects: {"rule": "self.components['Widget'].priority < 10"} - Rule scoped to a list of integers: {"rule": "self.values.all(value, value >= 0 && value < 100)"} - Rule scoped to a string value: {"rule": "self.startsWith('kube')"}
          
          The `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` and `metadata.generateName` are always accessible from the root of the object and from any x-kubernetes-embedded-resource annotated objects. No other metadata properties are accessible.
          
          Unknown data preserved in custom resources via x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields is not accessible in CEL expressions. This includes: - Unknown field values that are preserved by object schemas with x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields. - Object properties where the property schema is of an "unknown type". An "unknown type" is recursively defined as:
          - A schema with no type and x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields set to true
          - An array where the items schema is of an "unknown type"
          - An object where the additionalProperties schema is of an "unknown type"
          
          Only property names of the form `[a-zA-Z_.-/][a-zA-Z0-9_.-/]*` are accessible. Accessible property names are escaped according to the following rules when accessed in the expression: - '__' escapes to '__underscores__' - '.' escapes to '__dot__' - '-' escapes to '__dash__' - '/' escapes to '__slash__' - Property names that exactly match a CEL RESERVED keyword escape to '__{keyword}__'. The keywords are:
          "true", "false", "null", "in", "as", "break", "const", "continue", "else", "for", "function", "if",
          "import", "let", "loop", "package", "namespace", "return".
          Examples:
          - Rule accessing a property named "namespace": {"rule": "self.__namespace__ > 0"}
          - Rule accessing a property named "x-prop": {"rule": "self.x__dash__prop > 0"}
          - Rule accessing a property named "redact__d": {"rule": "self.redact__underscores__d > 0"}
          
          Equality on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type of 'set' or 'map' ignores element order, i.e. [1, 2] == [2, 1]. Concatenation on arrays with x-kubernetes-list-type use the semantics of the list type:
          - 'set': `X + Y` performs a union where the array positions of all elements in `X` are preserved and
          non-intersecting elements in `Y` are appended, retaining their partial order.
          - 'map': `X + Y` performs a merge where the array positions of all keys in `X` are preserved but the values
          are overwritten by values in `Y` when the key sets of `X` and `Y` intersect. Elements in `Y` with
          non-intersecting keys are appended, retaining their partial order.
          
          If `rule` makes use of the `oldSelf` variable it is implicitly a `transition rule`.
          
          By default, the `oldSelf` variable is the same type as `self`. When `optionalOldSelf` is true, the `oldSelf` variable is a CEL optional
          variable whose value() is the same type as `self`.
          See the documentation for the `optionalOldSelf` field for details.
          
          Transition rules by default are applied only on UPDATE requests and are skipped if an old value could not be found. You can opt a transition rule into unconditional evaluation by setting `optionalOldSelf` to true.

      versions:
        description: >-
          versions is the list of all API versions of the defined custom
          resource. Version names are used to compute the order in which served
          versions are listed in API discovery. If the version string is "kube-
          like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are
          ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then
          are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the
          string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These
          are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no
          suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version,
          then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1,
          v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.
