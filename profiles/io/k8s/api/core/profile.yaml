          this init container will be continually restarted on exit until all

          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after

It is not possible to share the same volume among privileged and unprivileged Pods. Eligible volumes are in-tree FibreChannel and iSCSI volumes, and all CSI volumes whose CSI driver announces SELinux support by setting spec.seLinuxMount: true in their CSIDriver instance. Other volumes are always re-labelled recursively. "MountOption" value is allowed only when SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled.
          
          If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is enabled, "MountOption" is used. If not specified and SELinuxMount feature gate is disabled, "MountOption" is used for ReadWriteOncePod volumes and "Recursive" for all other volumes.

          number of matching pods in an eligible domain or zero if the number of
          eligible domains is less than MinDomains. For example, in a 3-zone
          cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector
          spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global minimum is 1. | zone1 |

      minDomains:
        description: >-
          MinDomains indicates a minimum number of eligible domains. When the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys is less than minDomains, Pod Topology Spread treats "global minimum" as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling. As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains, scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains. If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not nil, WhenUnsatisfiable must be DoNotSchedule.
          
          For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than 5(MinDomains), so "global minimum" is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones, it will violate MaxSkew.

          skew.
          A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for an incoming pod if and only if every possible node assignment for that pod would violate "MaxSkew" on some topology. For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods with the same labelSelector spread as 3/1/1: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | | P P P |   P   |   P   | If WhenUnsatisfiable is set to DoNotSchedule, incoming pod can only be scheduled to zone2(zone3) to become 3/2/1(3/1/2) as ActualSkew(2-1) on zone2(zone3) satisfies MaxSkew(1).

The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).
          
          An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

          Alpha, gated by the ClusterTrustBundleProjection feature gate.
          
          ClusterTrustBundle objects can either be selected by name, or by the combination of signer name and a label selector.
          
          Kubelet performs aggressive normalization of the PEM contents written into the pod filesystem.  Esoteric PEM features such as inter-block comments and block headers are stripped.  Certificates are deduplicated. The ordering of certificates within the file is arbitrary, and Kubelet may change the order over time.

      podCertificate:
        description: >-
          Projects an auto-rotating credential bundle (private key and certificate chain) that the pod can use either as a TLS client or server.
          
          Kubelet generates a private key and uses it to send a PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once the signer approves the request and issues a certificate chain, Kubelet writes the key and certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The pod does not start until certificates have been issued for each podCertificate projected volume source in its spec.
          
          Kubelet will begin trying to rotate the certificate at the time indicated by the signer using the PodCertificateRequest.Status.BeginRefreshAt timestamp.
          
          Kubelet can write a single file, indicated by the credentialBundlePath field, or separate files, indicated by the keyPath and certificateChainPath fields.
          
          The credential bundle is a single file in PEM format.  The first PEM entry is the private key (in PKCS#8 format), and the remaining PEM entries are the certificate chain issued by the signer (typically, signers will return their certificate chain in leaf-to-root order).
          
          Prefer using the credential bundle format, since your application code can read it atomically.  If you use keyPath and certificateChainPath, your application must make two separate file reads. If these coincide with a certificate rotation, it is possible that the private key and leaf certificate you read may not correspond to each other.  Your application will need to check for this condition, and re-read until they are consistent.
          
          The named signer controls chooses the format of the certificate it issues; consult the signer implementation's documentation to learn how to use the certificates it issues.

          "ClusterIP" allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing
          to endpoints. Endpoints are determined by the selector or if that is
          not specified, by manual construction of an Endpoints object or
          EndpointSlice objects. If clusterIP is "None", no virtual IP is
          allocated and the endpoints are published as a set of endpoints rather
          than a virtual IP. "NodePort" builds on ClusterIP and allocates a port
          on every node which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.
          "LoadBalancer" builds on NodePort and creates an external load-
          balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same

          checkpoint the payload associated with Spec.ConfigSource, attempting
          to load or validate the Assigned config, etc. Errors may occur at
          different points while syncing config. Earlier errors (e.g. download
          or checkpointing errors) will not result in a rollback to
          LastKnownGood, and may resolve across Kubelet retries. Later errors
          (e.g. loading or validating a checkpointed config) will result in a
          rollback to LastKnownGood. In the latter case, it is usually possible
          to resolve the error by fixing the config assigned in
          Spec.ConfigSource. You can find additional information for debugging
          by searching the error message in the Kubelet log. Error is a human-
          readable description of the error state; machines can check whether or

          The Assigned config becomes the LastKnownGood config when the node
          determines that the Assigned config is stable and correct. This is
          currently implemented as a 10-minute soak period starting when the
          local record of Assigned config is updated. If the Assigned config is
          Active at the end of this period, it becomes the LastKnownGood. Note
          that if Spec.ConfigSource is reset to nil (use local defaults), the
          LastKnownGood is also immediately reset to nil, because the local
          default config is always assumed good. You should not make assumptions
          about the node's method of determining config stability and
          correctness, as this may change or become configurable in the future.

          * Un-prefixed keys:
          - storage - the capacity of the volume.
          * Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
          Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered reserved and hence may not be used.
          
          ClaimResourceStatus can be in any of following states:
          - ControllerResizeInProgress:
          State set when resize controller starts resizing the volume in control-plane.
          - ControllerResizeFailed:
          State set when resize has failed in resize controller with a terminal error.
          - NodeResizePending:
          State set when resize controller has finished resizing the volume but further resizing of
          volume is needed on the node.
          - NodeResizeInProgress:
          State set when kubelet starts resizing the volume.
          - NodeResizeFailed:
          State set when resizing has failed in kubelet with a terminal error. Transient errors don't set
          NodeResizeFailed.
          For example: if expanding a PVC for more capacity - this field can be one of the following states:
          - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeInProgress"
          - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "ControllerResizeFailed"
          - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizePending"
          - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeInProgress"
          - pvc.status.allocatedResourceStatus['storage'] = "NodeResizeFailed"
          When this field is not set, it means that no resize operation is in progress for the given PVC.
          
          A controller that receives PVC update with previously unknown resourceName or ClaimResourceStatus should ignore the update for the purpose it was designed. For example - a controller that only is responsible for resizing capacity of the volume, should ignore PVC updates that change other valid resources associated with PVC.

          * Custom resources must use implementation-defined prefixed names such as "example.com/my-custom-resource"
          Apart from above values - keys that are unprefixed or have kubernetes.io prefix are considered reserved and hence may not be used.
          
          Capacity reported here may be larger than the actual capacity when a volume expansion operation is requested. For storage quota, the larger value from allocatedResources and PVC.spec.resources is used. If allocatedResources is not set, PVC.spec.resources alone is used for quota calculation. If a volume expansion capacity request is lowered, allocatedResources is only lowered if there are no expansion operations in progress and if the actual volume capacity is equal or lower than the requested capacity.
