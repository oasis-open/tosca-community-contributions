  RuntimeClass:
    description: >-
      RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the
      cluster. The RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime
      is used to run all containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are manually
      defined by a user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the
      PodSpec. The Kubelet is responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName
      reference before running the pod.  For more details, see
      https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/

          APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an

          internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info:

      handler:
        description: >-
          handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the
          CRI implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible
          values are specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is assumed
          that all handlers are available on every node, and handlers of the
          same name are equivalent on every node. For example, a handler called
          "runc" might specify that the runc OCI runtime (using native Linux
          containers) will be used to run the containers in a pod. The Handler
          must be lowercase, conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements,
          and is immutable.

      scheduling:

          scheduling holds the scheduling constraints to ensure that pods
          running with this RuntimeClass are scheduled to nodes that support it.
          If scheduling is nil, this RuntimeClass is assumed to be supported by
          all nodes.

          nodeSelector lists labels that must be present on nodes that support
          this RuntimeClass. Pods using this RuntimeClass can only be scheduled
          to a node matched by this selector. The RuntimeClass nodeSelector is
          merged with a pod's existing nodeSelector. Any conflicts will cause
          the pod to be rejected in admission.
