      should be used by UIs to show/hide actions, or to quickly let an end
      user reason about their permissions. It should NOT Be used by external
      systems to drive authorization decisions as this raises confused
      deputy, cache lifetime/revocation, and correctness concerns.
      SubjectAccessReview, and LocalAccessReview are the correct way to
      defer authorization decisions to the API server.

  SubjectRulesReviewStatus:
    description: >-
      SubjectRulesReviewStatus contains the result of a rules check. This
      check can be incomplete depending on the set of authorizers the server
      is configured with and any errors experienced during evaluation.
      Because authorization rules are additive, if a rule appears in a list
      it's safe to assume the subject has that permission, even if that list
      is incomplete.
    properties:
      evaluationError:
        description: >-
          EvaluationError can appear in combination with Rules. It indicates an
          error occurred during rule evaluation, such as an authorizer that
          doesn't support rule evaluation, and that ResourceRules and/or
          NonResourceRules may be incomplete.
        required: false
        type: string
      incomplete:
        description: >-
          Incomplete is true when the rules returned by this call are
          incomplete. This is most commonly encountered when an authorizer, such
          as an external authorizer, doesn't support rules evaluation.
        required: true
        type: boolean
      nonResourceRules:
        description: >-
          NonResourceRules is the list of actions the subject is allowed to
          perform on non-resources. The list ordering isn't significant, may
          contain duplicates, and possibly be incomplete.

        description: >-
          ResourceRules is the list of actions the subject is allowed to perform
          on resources. The list ordering isn't significant, may contain
          duplicates, and possibly be incomplete.
