  EndpointSlice:
    description: >-
      EndpointSlice represents a set of service endpoints. Most
      EndpointSlices are created by the EndpointSlice controller to
      represent the Pods selected by Service objects. For a given service
      there may be multiple EndpointSlice objects which must be joined to
      produce the full set of endpoints; you can find all of the slices for
      a given service by listing EndpointSlices in the service's namespace
      whose `kubernetes.io/service-name` label contains the service's name.

          currently supported: * IPv4: Represents an IPv4 Address. * IPv6:
          Represents an IPv6 Address. * FQDN: Represents a Fully Qualified
          Domain Name. (Deprecated) The EndpointSlice controller only generates,
          and kube-proxy only processes, slices of addressType "IPv4" and
          "IPv6". No semantics are defined for the "FQDN" type.

          EndpointSlices generated by the EndpointSlice controller will likewise
          always have at least 1 port. EndpointSlices used for other purposes
          may have an empty ports list.

          ready indicates that this endpoint is ready to receive traffic,
          according to whatever system is managing the endpoint. A nil value
          should be interpreted as "true". In general, an endpoint should be
          marked ready if it is serving and not terminating, though this can be
          overridden in some cases, such as when the associated Service has set
          the publishNotReadyAddresses flag.

          backed by pods, the EndpointSlice controller will mark the endpoint as

          addresses of this endpoint. For EndpointSlices of addressType "IPv4"
          or "IPv6", the values are IP addresses in canonical form. The syntax
          and semantics of other addressType values are not defined. This must
          contain at least one address but no more than 100. EndpointSlices
          generated by the EndpointSlice controller will always have exactly 1
          address. No semantics are defined for additional addresses beyond the
          first, and kube-proxy does not look at them.

          deprecatedTopology contains topology information part of the v1beta1
          API. This field is deprecated, and will be removed when the v1beta1
          API is removed (no sooner than kubernetes v1.24).  While this field
          can hold values, it is not writable through the v1 API, and any
          attempts to write to it will be silently ignored. Topology information
          can be found in the zone and nodeName fields instead.

      hostname:
        description: >-
          hostname of this endpoint. This field may be used by consumers of
          endpoints to distinguish endpoints from each other (e.g. in DNS
          names). Multiple endpoints which use the same hostname should be
          considered fungible (e.g. multiple A values in DNS). Must be lowercase
          and pass DNS Label (RFC 1123) validation.
        required: false

      nodeName:

    properties:
      appProtocol:
        description: >-
          The application protocol for this port. This is used as a hint for implementations to offer richer behavior for protocols that they understand. This field follows standard Kubernetes label syntax. Valid values are either:

          * Kubernetes-defined prefixed names:
          * 'kubernetes.io/h2c' - HTTP/2 prior knowledge over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#name-starting-http-2-with-prior-
          * 'kubernetes.io/ws'  - WebSocket over cleartext as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455
          * 'kubernetes.io/wss' - WebSocket over TLS as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455
          
          * Other protocols should use implementation-defined prefixed names such as mycompany.com/my-custom-protocol.
        required: false
        type: string
      name:
        description: >-
          name represents the name of this port. All ports in an EndpointSlice
          must have a unique name. If the EndpointSlice is derived from a
          Kubernetes service, this corresponds to the Service.ports[].name. Name
          must either be an empty string or pass DNS_LABEL validation: * must be
          no more than 63 characters long. * must consist of lower case
          alphanumeric characters or '-'. * must start and end with an
          alphanumeric character. Default is empty string.
        required: false
        type: string
      port:
        description: >-
          port represents the port number of the endpoint. If the EndpointSlice
          is derived from a Kubernetes service, this must be set to the
          service's target port. EndpointSlices used for other purposes may have
          a nil port.
