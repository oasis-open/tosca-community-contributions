      handSize:
        description: >-
          `handSize` is a small positive number that configures the shuffle
          sharding of requests into queues.  When enqueuing a request at this
          priority level the request's flow identifier (a string pair) is hashed
          and the hash value is used to shuffle the list of queues and deal a
          hand of the size specified here.  The request is put into one of the
          shortest queues in that hand. `handSize` must be no larger than
          `queues`, and should be significantly smaller (so that a few heavy
          flows do not saturate most of the queues).  See the user-facing
          documentation for more extensive guidance on setting this field.  This
          field has a default value of 8.

        type: QueuingConfiguration
      type:
        description: >-
          `type` is "Queue" or "Reject". "Queue" means that requests that can

          that can not be executed upon arrival are rejected. Required.

  LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration:
    description: >-
      LimitedPriorityLevelConfiguration specifies how to handle requests that are subject to limits. It addresses two issues:
      - How are requests for this priority level limited?
      - What should be done with requests that exceed the limit?
    properties:
      borrowingLimitPercent:
        description: >-
          `borrowingLimitPercent`, if present, configures a limit on how many seats this priority level can borrow from other priority levels. The limit is known as this level's BorrowingConcurrencyLimit (BorrowingCL) and is a limit on the total number of seats that this level may borrow at any one time. This field holds the ratio of that limit to the level's nominal concurrency limit. When this field is non-nil, it must hold a non-negative integer and the limit is calculated as follows.
          
          BorrowingCL(i) = round( NominalCL(i) * borrowingLimitPercent(i)/100.0 )
          
          The value of this field can be more than 100, implying that this priority level can borrow a number of seats that is greater than its own nominal concurrency limit (NominalCL). When this field is left `nil`, the limit is effectively infinite.

      lendablePercent:
        description: >-
          `lendablePercent` prescribes the fraction of the level's NominalCL that can be borrowed by other priority levels. The value of this field must be between 0 and 100, inclusive, and it defaults to 0. The number of seats that other levels can borrow from this level, known as this level's LendableConcurrencyLimit (LendableCL), is defined as follows.
          
          LendableCL(i) = round( NominalCL(i) * lendablePercent(i)/100.0 )

      nominalConcurrencyShares:
        description: >-
          `nominalConcurrencyShares` (NCS) contributes to the computation of the NominalConcurrencyLimit (NominalCL) of this level. This is the number of execution seats available at this priority level. This is used both for requests dispatched from this priority level as well as requests dispatched from other priority levels borrowing seats from this level. The server's concurrency limit (ServerCL) is divided among the Limited priority levels in proportion to their NCS values:
          
          NominalCL(i)  = ceil( ServerCL * NCS(i) / sum_ncs ) sum_ncs = sum[priority level k] NCS(k)
          
          Bigger numbers mean a larger nominal concurrency limit, at the expense of every other priority level.
          
          If not specified, this field defaults to a value of 30.
          
          Setting this field to zero supports the construction of a "jail" for this priority level that is used to hold some request(s)

      type:
        description: >-
          `type` indicates whether this priority level is subject to limitation
          on request execution.  A value of `"Exempt"` means that requests of
          this priority level are not subject to a limit (and thus are never
          queued) and do not detract from the capacity made available to other
          priority levels.  A value of `"Limited"` means that (a) requests of
          this priority level _are_ subject to limits and (b) some of the
          server's limited capacity is made available exclusively to this
          priority level. Required.
