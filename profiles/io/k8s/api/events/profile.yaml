  Event:
    description: >-
      Event is a report of an event somewhere in the cluster. It generally
      denotes some state change in the system. Events have a limited
      retention time and triggers and messages may evolve with time.  Event
      consumers should not rely on the timing of an event with a given
      Reason reflecting a consistent underlying trigger, or the continued
      existence of events with that Reason.  Events should be treated as
      informative, best-effort, supplemental data.
