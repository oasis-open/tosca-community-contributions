  ResourceSlice:

      ResourceSlice represents one or more resources in a pool of similar resources, managed by a common driver. A pool may span more than one ResourceSlice, and exactly how many ResourceSlices comprise a pool is determined by the driver.
      
      At the moment, the only supported resources are devices with attributes and capacities. Each device in a given pool, regardless of how many ResourceSlices, must have a unique name. The ResourceSlice in which a device gets published may change over time. The unique identifier for a device is the tuple <driver name>, <pool name>, <device name>.
      
      Whenever a driver needs to update a pool, it increments the pool.Spec.Pool.Generation number and updates all ResourceSlices with that new number and new resource definitions. A consumer must only use ResourceSlices with the highest generation number and ignore all others.
      
      When allocating all resources in a pool matching certain criteria or when looking for the best solution among several different alternatives, a consumer should check the number of ResourceSlices in a pool (included in each ResourceSlice) to determine whether its view of a pool is complete and if not, should wait until the driver has completed updating the pool.
      
      For resources that are not local to a node, the node name is not set. Instead, the driver may use a node selector to specify where the devices are available.

      generation:
        description: >-
          Generation tracks the change in a pool over time. Whenever a driver changes something about one or more of the resources in a pool, it must change the generation in all ResourceSlices which are part of that pool. Consumers of ResourceSlices should only consider resources from the pool with the highest generation number. The generation may be reset by drivers, which should be fine for consumers, assuming that all ResourceSlices in a pool are updated to match or deleted.
          
          Combined with ResourceSliceCount, this mechanism enables consumers to detect pools which are comprised of multiple ResourceSlices and are in an incomplete state.

          This acts as the inverse of MatchAttribute.
          
          This constraint is used to avoid allocating multiple requests to the same device by ensuring attribute-level differentiation.
          
          This is useful for scenarios where resource requests must be fulfilled by separate physical devices. For example, a container requests two network interfaces that must be allocated from two different physical NICs.

A device which does not have that attribute will not be chosen. All devices should use a value of the same type for this attribute because that is part of its specification, but if one device doesn't, then it also will not be chosen.

  CapacityRequirements:

      requests:

          Requests represent individual device resource requests for distinct resources, all of which must be provided by the device.
          
          This value is used as an additional filtering condition against the available capacity on the device. This is semantically equivalent to a CEL selector with `device.capacity[<domain>].<name>.compareTo(quantity(<request quantity>)) >= 0`. For example, device.capacity['test-driver.cdi.k8s.io'].counters.compareTo(quantity('2')) >= 0.
          
          When a requestPolicy is defined, the requested amount is adjusted upward to the nearest valid value based on the policy. If the requested amount cannot be adjusted to a valid value—because it exceeds what the requestPolicy allows— the device is considered ineligible for allocation.
          
          For any capacity that is not explicitly requested: - If no requestPolicy is set, the default consumed capacity is equal to the full device capacity
          (i.e., the whole device is claimed).
          - If a requestPolicy is set, the default consumed capacity is determined according to that policy.
          
          If the device allows multiple allocation, the aggregated amount across all requests must not exceed the capacity value. The consumed capacity, which may be adjusted based on the requestPolicy if defined, is recorded in the resource claim’s status.devices[*].consumedCapacity field.

  CELDeviceSelector:
    description: CELDeviceSelector contains a CEL expression for selecting a device.
    properties:
      expression:
        description: >-
          Expression is a CEL expression which evaluates a single device. It must evaluate to true when the device under consideration satisfies the desired criteria, and false when it does not. Any other result is an error and causes allocation of devices to abort.
          
          The expression's input is an object named "device", which carries the following properties:
          - driver (string): the name of the driver which defines this device.
          - attributes (map[string]object): the device's attributes, grouped by prefix
          (e.g. device.attributes["dra.example.com"] evaluates to an object with all
          of the attributes which were prefixed by "dra.example.com".
          - capacity (map[string]object): the device's capacities, grouped by prefix.
          - allowMultipleAllocations (bool): the allowMultipleAllocations property of the device
          (v1.34+ with the DRAConsumableCapacity feature enabled).
          
          Example: Consider a device with driver="dra.example.com", which exposes two attributes named "model" and "ext.example.com/family" and which exposes one capacity named "modules". This input to this expression would have the following fields:
          
          device.driver
          device.attributes["dra.example.com"].model
          device.attributes["ext.example.com"].family
          device.capacity["dra.example.com"].modules
          
          The device.driver field can be used to check for a specific driver, either as a high-level precondition (i.e. you only want to consider devices from this driver) or as part of a multi-clause expression that is meant to consider devices from different drivers.
          
          The value type of each attribute is defined by the device definition, and users who write these expressions must consult the documentation for their specific drivers. The value type of each capacity is Quantity.
          
          If an unknown prefix is used as a lookup in either device.attributes or device.capacity, an empty map will be returned. Any reference to an unknown field will cause an evaluation error and allocation to abort.
          
          A robust expression should check for the existence of attributes before referencing them.
          
          For ease of use, the cel.bind() function is enabled, and can be used to simplify expressions that access multiple attributes with the same domain. For example:
          
          cel.bind(dra, device.attributes["dra.example.com"], dra.someBool && dra.anotherBool)
          
          The length of the expression must be smaller or equal to 10 Ki. The cost of evaluating it is also limited based on the estimated number of logical steps.

          ExtendedResourceName is the extended resource name for the devices of this class. The devices of this class can be used to satisfy a pod's extended resource requests. It has the same format as the name of a pod's extended resource. It should be unique among all the device classes in a cluster. If two device classes have the same name, then the class created later is picked to satisfy a pod's extended resource requests. If two classes are created at the same time, then the name of the class lexicographically sorted first is picked.
          
          This is an alpha field.
