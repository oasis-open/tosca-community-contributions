  ControllerRevision:
    description: >-
      ControllerRevision implements an immutable snapshot of state data.
      Clients are responsible for serializing and deserializing the objects
      that contain their internal state. Once a ControllerRevision has been
      successfully created, it can not be updated. The API Server will fail
      validation of all requests that attempt to mutate the Data field.
      ControllerRevisions may, however, be deleted. Note that, due to its
      use by both the DaemonSet and StatefulSet controllers for update and
      rollback, this object is beta. However, it may be subject to name and
      representation changes in future releases, and clients should not
      depend on its stability. It is primarily for internal use by
      controllers.

          The maximum number of nodes with an existing available DaemonSet pod

          can be an absolute number (ex: 5) or a percentage of desired pods (ex:
          10%). This can not be 0 if MaxUnavailable is 0. Absolute number is
          calculated from percentage by rounding up to a minimum of 1. Default
          value is 0. Example: when this is set to 30%, at most 30% of the total
          number of nodes that should be running the daemon pod (i.e.
          status.desiredNumberScheduled) can have their a new pod created before
          the old pod is marked as deleted. The update starts by launching new
          pods on 30% of nodes. Once an updated pod is available (Ready for at
          least minReadySeconds) the old DaemonSet pod on that node is marked
          deleted. If the old pod becomes unavailable for any reason (Ready
          transitions to false, is evicted, or is drained) an updated pod is
          immediately created on that node without considering surge limits.
          Allowing surge implies the possibility that the resources consumed by
          the daemonset on any given node can double if the readiness check
          fails, and so resource intensive daemonsets should take into account

          Absolute number is calculated from percentage by rounding up. This
          cannot be 0 if MaxSurge is 0 Default value is 1. Example: when this is

          DaemonSet pods in their place. Once the new pods are available, it
