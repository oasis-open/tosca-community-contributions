  FieldsV1:
    description: >-
      FieldsV1 stores a set of fields in a data structure like a Trie, in JSON format.
      
      Each key is either a '.' representing the field itself, and will always map to an empty set, or a string representing a sub-field or item. The string will follow one of these four formats: 'f:<name>', where <name> is the name of a field in a struct, or key in a map 'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item 'i:<index>', where <index> is position of a item in a list 'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.
      
      The exact format is defined in sigs.k8s.io/structured-merge-diff

          Subresource is the name of the subresource used to update that object,
          or empty string if the object was updated through the main resource.
          The value of this field is used to distinguish between managers, even
          if they share the same name. For example, a status update will be
          distinct from a regular update using the same manager name. Note that
          the APIVersion field is not related to the Subresource field and it
          always corresponds to the version of the main resource.
        required: false
        type: string
      time:
        description: >-
          Time is the timestamp of when the ManagedFields entry was added. The
          timestamp will also be updated if a field is added, the manager
          changes any of the owned fields value or removes a field. The
          timestamp does not update when a field is removed from the entry
          because another manager took it over.

      OwnerReference contains enough information to let you identify an

      deletionTimestamp:
        description: >-
          DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

      finalizers:
        description: >-
          Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each
          entry is an identifier for the responsible component that will remove
          the entry from the list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is
          non-nil, entries in this list can only be removed. Finalizers may be
          processed and removed in any order.  Order is NOT enforced because it
          introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a
          shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the
          finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a
          situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer
          in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or
          other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in
          the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering
          finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable
          to ordering changes in the list.

          The duration in seconds before the object should be deleted. Value
          must be non-negative integer. The value zero indicates delete
          immediately. If this value is nil, the default grace period for the
          specified type will be used. Defaults to a per object value if not
          specified. zero means delete immediately.

          if set to true, it will trigger an unsafe deletion of the resource in
          case the normal deletion flow fails with a corrupt object error. A
          resource is considered corrupt if it can not be retrieved from the
          underlying storage successfully because of a) its data can not be
          transformed e.g. decryption failure, or b) it fails to decode into an
          object. NOTE: unsafe deletion ignores finalizer constraints, skips
          precondition checks, and removes the object from the storage. WARNING:
          This may potentially break the cluster if the workload associated with
          the resource being unsafe-deleted relies on normal deletion flow. Use
          only if you REALLY know what you are doing. The default value is
          false, and the user must opt in to enable it

          collector to delete the dependents in the background; 'Foreground' - a
          cascading policy that deletes all dependents in the foreground.
