          CABundle is a PEM encoded CA bundle which will be used to validate an

      groupPriorityMinimum:

          GroupPriorityMinimum is the priority this group should have at least.
          Higher priority means that the group is preferred by clients over
          lower priority ones. Note that other versions of this group might
          specify even higher GroupPriorityMinimum values such that the whole
          group gets a higher priority. The primary sort is based on
          GroupPriorityMinimum, ordered highest number to lowest (20 before 10).
          The secondary sort is based on the alphabetical comparison of the name
          of the object.  (v1.bar before v1.foo) We'd recommend something like:
          *.k8s.io (except extensions) at 18000 and PaaSes (OpenShift, Deis) are
          recommended to be in the 2000s

          InsecureSkipTLSVerify disables TLS certificate verification when

          should use the CABundle instead.

      service:
        description: >-
          Service is a reference to the service for this API server.  It must
          communicate on port 443. If the Service is nil, that means the
          handling for the API groupversion is handled locally on this server.
          The call will simply delegate to the normal handler chain to be
          fulfilled.

      versionPriority:
        description: >-
          VersionPriority controls the ordering of this API version inside of
          its group.  Must be greater than zero. The primary sort is based on
          VersionPriority, ordered highest to lowest (20 before 10). Since it's
          inside of a group, the number can be small, probably in the 10s. In
          case of equal version priorities, the version string will be used to
          compute the order inside a group. If the version string is "kube-
          like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are
          ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then
          are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the
          string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These
          are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no
          suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version,
          then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1,
          v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.
