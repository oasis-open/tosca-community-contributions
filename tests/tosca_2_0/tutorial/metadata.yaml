# Metadata does not have any specified use
# But, because it's compiled to Clout, it's a great way to add hints for your Clout processor
# or orchestrator

# For example, Puccini uses metadata to define custom functions
# See: examples/javascript/

# The service template can have optional metadata
metadata:
  # The following fields are "normative" and expected in TOSCA 
  template_name: Metadata Example
  template_author: Puccini
  template_version: '1.0' # (must be a string so we add quotes to avoid being read as a float)
  # And you can add your custom metadata
  # (The "." has no special general meaning for metadata names)
  galactic.planet: Mercury

node_types:

  Server:
    derived_from: tosca:Compute
    # You can also add metadata to any type
    # Note that it is not normally inherited: every distinct type has its own metadata
    # However, every node template in Clout will get a map of its entire type hierarchy with the
    # metadata for each one, so you can decide to interpret any metadata as inheritable
    metadata:
      galactic.planet: Jupiter

service_template:

  node_templates:

    server:
      type: Server
      # Node templates don't have metadata, but you can assign a list of string directives
      # The only "normative" directive mentioned in the TOSCA spec is "substitutable"
      # (See: substitution-mapping-client.yaml) 
      directives:
      - proxy
      - mock
      - disposable
